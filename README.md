# cpp/C++

A curated collection of C++ implementations focused on **correctness, performance, and clarity**.

This repository functions as both:
- a long-term personal technical archive
- a reference for well-structured C++ solutions across core language features and algorithmic problem solving

The emphasis is on **intentional code**, not volume.

---

## Scope

- Algorithms & data structures
- STL internals, patterns, and idioms
- Competitive programming solutions
- Edge-case analysis and failure-mode exploration
- Low-level behavior (memory, references, object lifetimes)
- Trade-offs between approaches (time, space, readability)

Code is added when it offers **distinct value**, not repetition.

---

## Language & Tooling

- **C++:** C++17 / C++20
- **Compilers:** GCC, Clang
- **Primary Environment:** VS Code (Linux/Windows)

---

## Repository Layout

..

Structure evolves to reflect usage, not convention.

---

## Design Principles

- Explicit over clever
- Predictable behavior over shortcuts
- Constraints understood before optimization
- Readability preserved under performance pressure

---

## Usage

- Each file is self-contained
- Assumes familiarity with C++
- Meant for review, reference, and adaptation — *not tutorials*

---

## Contributions

External contributions are evaluated on:
- technical correctness
- clarity of intent
- measurable improvement

Noise is filtered aggressively.

## Notes

This is **NOT** a teaching repository.  
Explanations are minimal by design.
